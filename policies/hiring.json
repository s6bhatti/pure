    "description": "Prevent the language model from responding to prompts regarding key hiring processes, including evaluating resumes, conducting interviews, or making hiring decisions. This is to comply with the EU AI Act, which restricts the use of AI in high-risk areas such as employment. Prompts that encourage learning about hiring practices without using LLMs for actual hiring decisions with a real-world impact are allowed. Note that the users of this LLM will mostly be company employees from the HR department.",
